# the decker

This is the source code of my personal website: http://www.thedecker.net

It is a static website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

I have containerized it using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), so I can start the server easliy regardless the environments

Currently the website is hosted on one of my spare laptops
